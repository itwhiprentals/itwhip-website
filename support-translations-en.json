    "faqQuestion2": "Are pets allowed in ItWhip rentals?",
    "faqAnswer2": "It depends on the host. Some hosts welcome pets (look for the \"pet-friendly\" badge), while others don't allow them. Never bring a pet in a non-pet-friendly vehicle\u2014this results in automatic deep cleaning fees.",

    "faqQuestion5": "What if the car was already dirty when I got it?",

    "faqQuestion2": "How much will I be charged for damage?",
    "faqAnswer2": "Charges depend on the repair cost and your protection plan. With basic coverage, you may be responsible for a deductible up to $2,500. Premium protection reduces this to $500 or less. We only charge actual repair costs - never inflated estimates.",
    "faqQuestion3": "What if the host claims damage I didn't cause?",
    "faqAnswer3": "This is why check-in and check-out photos are crucial. If you have documentation showing the damage existed before your trip, submit it with your response. Our team reviews all evidence from both parties to make a fair determination.",
    "faqQuestion4": "Am I responsible for tire/wheel damage?",
    "faqAnswer4": "Generally, yes. Tire punctures, curb rash on wheels, and similar damage during your trip is typically guest responsibility. However, wear-and-tear issues like worn treads are the host's responsibility.",
    "faqQuestion5": "What about interior damage or cleaning?",
    "faqAnswer5": "Excessive cleaning fees (beyond normal use) may be charged. This includes stains, odors, excessive pet hair, or trash left in the vehicle. Normal use wear is expected and not charged.",
    "faqQuestion6": "How does insurance work with damage claims?",
    "faqAnswer6": "ItWhip's $1M liability coverage protects you for third-party claims. For vehicle damage, your personal auto insurance or the protection plan you selected during booking applies. We'll guide you through the process.",
    "faqQuestion7": "Can I dispute a damage claim?",
    "faqAnswer7": "Yes. You have 48 hours to respond to any damage claim with your evidence. If you disagree with the resolution, you can request a review by our Trust & Safety team.",

    "faqQuestion1": "When is my security deposit charged?",
    "faqAnswer1": "Your security deposit is authorized (not charged) when your booking is confirmed, typically 24-48 hours before pickup. This creates a temporary hold on your card. If no damage or extra charges occur, the hold is released after the trip ends.",
    "faqQuestion2": "How do I get my deposit back?",
    "faqAnswer2": "If the vehicle is returned in the same condition, your deposit hold is automatically released within 3-7 business days after trip completion. Some banks may show the release immediately, while others take longer to process.",
    "faqQuestion3": "Can I reduce my deposit amount?",
    "faqAnswer3": "Yes! Guests with verified personal auto insurance can receive a 50% deposit reduction. Simply upload proof of your insurance coverage during the booking process, and we'll verify it qualifies.",
    "faqQuestion4": "What can the deposit be used for?",
    "faqAnswer4": "The deposit covers potential damage to the vehicle, excessive cleaning fees, late returns, toll violations, traffic tickets, mileage overages, and fuel replacement if not returned at the agreed level.",
    "faqQuestion5": "Why is a hold different from a charge?",
    "faqAnswer5": "An authorization hold temporarily reserves funds but doesn't transfer money. It appears as \"pending\" on your statement. Unlike a charge, holds automatically expire and release back to your available balance.",
    "faqQuestion6": "What if my card doesn't have enough for the deposit?",

    "faqQuestion1": "How do I file an insurance claim?",
    "faqAnswer1": "Report the incident immediately through the ItWhip app by going to your trip details and selecting \"Report Issue.\" Upload photos of any damage, provide a description of what happened, and submit. Our claims team will review within 24-48 hours.",
    "faqQuestion2": "What is my deductible?",
    "faqAnswer2": "Deductibles depend on your host tier: Tier 1 (Platform Insurance) = $2,500 collision / $1,000 comprehensive. Tier 2 (P2P) and Tier 3 (Commercial) = your own policy deductibles apply first, with platform backup coverage.",
    "faqQuestion3": "What does insurance cover during a trip?",
    "faqAnswer3": "Coverage includes: liability (bodily injury & property damage to third parties), collision damage to the rental vehicle, comprehensive coverage (theft, vandalism, weather), and 24/7 roadside assistance. Coverage is active ONLY during booked rental periods.",
    "faqQuestion4": "What is NOT covered?",
    "faqAnswer4": "Not covered: mechanical breakdowns, pre-existing damage, personal belongings, intentional damage, DUI incidents, unauthorized drivers, off-road use, and any use outside the rental period. Normal wear and tear is also excluded.",
    "faqQuestion5": "How long does a claim take to process?",
    "faqAnswer5": "Most claims are resolved within 48-72 hours. Complex claims involving third parties or disputes may take 5-7 business days. You'll receive updates via email and in-app notifications throughout the process.",
    "faqQuestion6": "What if my claim is denied?",
    "faqAnswer6": "If your primary insurance denies a claim, platform secondary coverage may still apply. You can appeal a denial by providing additional documentation. Contact our claims team at info@itwhip.com for assistance.",
    "faqQuestion7": "Do guests need their own insurance?",
    "faqAnswer7": "No, guests are covered by the host's tier coverage during trips. However, guests can purchase optional protection at checkout for reduced deductibles and 50% off their security deposit.",
    "faqQuestion8": "What happens if a guest damages my car?",
    "faqAnswer8": "Document the damage with photos before the guest leaves if possible. File a claim through the app immediately. The guest's security deposit can be applied toward repairs, and insurance covers amounts beyond the deposit up to policy limits.",
    "faqQuestion9": "Is coverage different for luxury/exotic cars?",
    "faqAnswer9": "Yes. High-value vehicles ($75K+) have higher deposits ($500-$2,500), require enhanced guest verification, and may have specific repair requirements (factory-authorized shops only). Coverage limits remain the same.",
    "faqQuestion10": "Can I upgrade my insurance tier?",
    "faqAnswer10": "Yes! Upload proof of P2P or commercial insurance through your host dashboard. Once verified (1-2 business days), your tier upgrades immediately and you'll earn more on future trips.",
