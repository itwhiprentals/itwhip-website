### Verify-First Flow (No Account Required)

  - If new email → Start Stripe Identity verification
- [x] Webhook auto-creates User + ReviewerProfile after verification
- [x] Name and DOB populated from driver's license data
- [x] After Stripe return, check for auto-created account

## Notes

### Stripe Identity Verification States
- `null` / not started → Yellow "Verify Your Identity" alert
- `pending` → Orange "Complete Your Verification" (user may not have finished)
- `requires_input` → Orange "Complete Your Verification" (Stripe needs more info)
- `verified` → No alert shown

### User Roles
- `ANONYMOUS` → Default for new users (maps to CLAIMED for guest access)
- `CLAIMED` → Verified guest
- `STARTER`, `BUSINESS`, `ENTERPRISE` → Upgraded tiers
