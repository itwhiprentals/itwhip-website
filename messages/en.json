    "section1Content": "ItWhip is Arizona's first peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace built specifically for the desert environment. We connect vehicle owners (Hosts) with renters (Guests) through a transparent platform that prioritizes trust, fair earnings, and environmental responsibility.\n\nSince our first ride in 2023 in Phoenix, Arizona, our team has focused on building the best car sharing experience for the Southwest. We understand Arizona's unique needs—from the extreme summer heat to the diverse terrain spanning desert valleys to mountain retreats.\n\nUnlike traditional rental companies, ItWhip offers hosts up to 90% of rental earnings based on their insurance tier. Our Mileage Forensics™ system provides complete transparency for every trip, while MaxAC™ certification ensures every vehicle is tested for Arizona's extreme heat.\n\nToday, ItWhip serves 18 cities across Arizona, including Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Sedona, Tucson, and Flagstaff—covering everything, everywhere across the state.\n\nOur platform offers diverse vehicle options: economy cars for daily errands, luxury vehicles for special occasions, SUVs for outdoor adventures, and everything in between.

    "faqDifferenceQuestion": "How is ItWhip different from Turo?",
    "faqDifferenceAnswer": "ItWhip is a peer-to-peer car sharing platform focused on Arizona. We offer transparent insurance tiers where YOU choose your earnings (40-90%), $1M liability coverage on all trips, advanced Mileage Forensics™ fraud prevention, and ESG impact tracking. We serve 10+ cities across the Phoenix metro and Tucson areas.",
    "faqInsuranceQuestion": "What insurance is included?",
    "faqInsuranceAnswer": "Every trip includes $1M liability coverage regardless of your tier. Physical damage coverage (collision & comprehensive), roadside assistance, and loss of use compensation are also included. Your tier determines who's primary: BASIC uses platform insurance, STANDARD/PREMIUM use your insurance with platform as backup.",
    "faqVerificationQuestion": "How does guest verification work?",
    "faqVerificationAnswer": "Guests complete a simple 4-step verification: upload driver's license, take a selfie for ID matching, pass automated background/driving record check, and add a payment method. This is a one-time process for all future rentals. Guests who add personal insurance get 50% off security deposits.",
    "faqPickupQuestion": "What are the pickup options?",
    "faqPickupAnswer": "Multiple convenient options: meet your host at a local spot, pick up at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, or request delivery to your address (fees may apply). You'll receive detailed instructions after booking.",
    "faqCommissionQuestion": "How do the commission tiers work?",
    "faqCommissionAnswer": "Your earnings are based on your fleet size: Standard (75%) for 1-9 vehicles, Gold (80%) for 10-49 vehicles, Platinum (85%) for 50-99 vehicles, and Diamond (90%) for 100+ vehicles. All tiers include $1M liability coverage.",
    "faqEarningsQuestion": "How much can I earn?",
    "faqEarningsAnswer": "Earnings vary by vehicle and tier. At the 90% tier: Economy cars average $800-1,400/month, standard vehicles $1,200-2,000/month, luxury $2,000-4,000/month based on 15-20 rental days. Growing your fleet gets you to higher tiers faster.",
    "faqPaymentQuestion": "When do hosts get paid?",
    "faqPaymentAnswer": "Within 48 hours of trip completion via direct deposit - the fastest in the industry. You can track all earnings in real-time through your host dashboard. We also provide automated 1099 tax documentation.",
    "faqMileageQuestion": "What is Mileage Forensics™?",
    "faqMileageAnswer": "Our proprietary system that tracks odometer readings between trips to verify usage patterns, detect potential fraud, and ensure hosts are using vehicles according to their declared usage type. This protects both hosts and insurance partners.",
    "faqDamageQuestion": "What happens if there's damage?",
    "faqDamageAnswer": "Our FNOL (First Notice of Loss) system captures all information insurers need. Report damage within 24 hours through the app with photos. Claims are typically resolved within 48-72 hours. Your deductible depends on your tier: BASIC $2,500, STANDARD $1,500, PREMIUM $1,000.",
    "faqExpansionQuestion": "Is ItWhip available outside Arizona?",
    "faqExpansionAnswer": "Currently, we're focused on the Phoenix metro area and Arizona. We operate under Arizona's P2P car sharing legislation (A.R.S. § 28-9601). Expansion to other states is planned for 2026.",

    "qWhatIsP2P": "What is peer-to-peer car rental?",
    "aWhatIsP2P": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) car rental is a car sharing model where private vehicle owners rent their personal cars directly to other people through a platform like ItWhip. Unlike traditional rental companies that own fleets, P2P connects local car owners with renters—offering more variety, better prices, and a personal touch. Think of it as Airbnb for cars.",
    "qItwhipVsTuro": "How is ItWhip different from Turo?",
    "aItwhipVsTuro": "ItWhip offers several advantages over Turo for Arizona hosts and guests: (1) Higher earnings—hosts keep up to 90% vs Turo's 60-85%, (2) Faster payments—48 hours vs 3-5 days, (3) Higher coverage—$1M liability vs $750K, (4) Mileage Forensics™—GPS-verified trip tracking Turo doesn't offer, (5) ESG Dashboard—environmental impact tracking, and (6) Arizona-focused—we know the local market, events, and compliance requirements.",
    "linkCompare": "Compare ItWhip vs Turo →",
    "qOutsideArizona": "Is ItWhip available outside Arizona?",
    "aOutsideArizona": "Currently, ItWhip operates exclusively in Arizona, serving the Phoenix metro area including Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, and Glendale. We're focused on delivering the best P2P car sharing experience in Arizona before expanding. Expansion to additional states is planned for 2026.",
    "linkCoverage": "View coverage areas →",
    "qLegalArizona": "Is peer-to-peer car rental legal in Arizona?",
    "aLegalArizona": "Yes, absolutely. Arizona has specific legislation governing P2P car sharing: A.R.S. § 28-9601 through 28-9613. This law establishes clear rules for platforms, hosts, and guests—including insurance requirements, liability protections, and tax obligations. ItWhip is fully compliant with all Arizona P2P car sharing regulations, and we handle Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) collection and remittance on your behalf.",
    "linkLegal": "Read full legal details →",
    "qWhatNeedToRent": "What do I need to rent a car on ItWhip?",
    "aWhatNeedToRent": "To rent on ItWhip, you need: (1) A valid driver's license (US or international), (2) Be at least 21 years old (25+ for luxury/exotic vehicles), (3) A valid credit or debit card, and (4) Pass our verification process including a background check and driving record review. The verification is quick—most guests are approved within minutes and it's a one-time process for all future rentals.",
    "linkStartRenting": "Start renting →",
    "qGuestInsurance": "How does insurance work when I rent?",
    "aGuestInsurance": "Every ItWhip rental includes $1M liability coverage automatically—no extra purchase required. This protects you if you cause injury or property damage to others. For damage to the rental vehicle itself, you're covered under the host's protection plan with deductibles ranging from $1,000-$2,500 depending on their tier. You can also add your own personal auto insurance to get 50% off the security deposit.",
    "qPickupOptions": "What are the pickup options?",
    "aPickupOptions": "ItWhip offers flexible pickup options: (1) Hotel delivery—free delivery to your accommodation, (2) Airport pickup—convenient locations near Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX), (3) Home delivery—have the car delivered to your address (fees may apply), or (4) Host meetup—meet the host at a mutually agreed location. You'll receive detailed pickup instructions after booking.",
    "linkBrowseCars": "Browse available cars →",
    "qAgeRequirement": "How old do I have to be to rent?",
    "aAgeRequirement": "The minimum age to rent on ItWhip is 21 years old. For luxury, exotic, and high-performance vehicles, you must be at least 25 years old. All renters must have a valid driver's license and pass our verification process regardless of age.",
    "qPersonalInsurance": "Can I add my own insurance for a discount?",
    "aPersonalInsurance": "Yes! Guests who verify their personal auto insurance through ItWhip receive a 50% discount on security deposits. Your personal insurance becomes tertiary coverage (after the host's insurance and platform insurance), but the real benefit is the reduced upfront cost. Simply upload your insurance card during verification to unlock the discount on all future rentals.",
    "qHowMuchEarn": "How much can I earn renting my car?",
    "aHowMuchEarn": "Host earnings depend on your vehicle type, rental frequency, and insurance tier. At the 90% tier: Economy cars average $800-1,400/month, standard vehicles $1,200-2,000/month, and luxury vehicles $2,000-4,000/month—based on 15-20 rental days. Phoenix hosts benefit from year-round demand, especially during major events like Barrett-Jackson, Spring Training, and the Waste Management Open.",
    "linkCalcEarnings": "Calculate your earnings →",
    "qInsuranceTiers": "How do the insurance tiers work (40/75/90%)?",
    "aInsuranceTiers": "Your earnings tier is determined by the insurance YOU bring: BASIC (40%)—you bring no insurance, we provide full platform coverage, best for new hosts getting started. STANDARD (75%)—you bring P2P insurance (like State Farm or Getaround coverage), your insurance is primary. PREMIUM (90%)—you bring commercial auto insurance, maximum earnings with lowest deductibles. All tiers include $1M liability coverage.",
    "linkInsuranceGuide": "Full insurance guide →",
    "qWhenPaid": "When do I get paid?",
    "aWhenPaid": "ItWhip pays hosts within 48 hours of trip completion—the fastest in the industry. Payments go directly to your bank account via direct deposit (Stripe Connect). You can track all earnings, pending payments, and completed payouts in real-time through your host dashboard. We also provide automated 1099 tax documentation at year-end.",
    "qMileageForensics": "What is Mileage Forensics™?",
    "aMileageForensics": "Mileage Forensics™ is ItWhip's proprietary system that tracks and verifies odometer readings between trips. It detects gaps in mileage that might indicate unreported personal use, fraud, or unauthorized trips. For hosts, this means complete transparency on how your vehicle is used. For insurers, it provides verified usage data for accurate underwriting. No other P2P platform offers this level of trip verification.",
    "linkMileageForensics": "Learn about Mileage Forensics →",
    "qVehicleRequirements": "What vehicles qualify to list?",
    "aVehicleRequirements": "To list on ItWhip, your vehicle must: (1) Be model year 2015 or newer, (2) Have under 130,000 miles, (3) Have a clean title (no salvage or rebuilt titles), (4) Pass a safety inspection, (5) Be registered and located in the Phoenix metro area, and (6) Have valid registration and be in good mechanical condition. Luxury, exotic, and specialty vehicles are welcome!",
    "qWorthIt": "Is renting out my car worth it?",
    "aWorthIt": "For most Arizona hosts, yes. Consider: The average ItWhip host earns $800-2,000/month with just 15-20 rental days. That could cover your entire car payment plus insurance. You also get tax benefits—vehicle depreciation, maintenance, and insurance are potentially deductible. Plus, with ItWhip's 90% tier, you keep more than any other platform. The math usually works in your favor, especially for vehicles that sit unused during work hours.",
    "linkStartEarning": "Start earning today →",
    "qCoverageIncluded": "What insurance coverage is included?",
    "aCoverageIncluded": "Every ItWhip trip includes: (1) $1,000,000 liability coverage—protects against third-party injury and property damage claims, (2) Comprehensive coverage—theft, vandalism, weather damage, (3) Collision coverage—damage from accidents, (4) 24/7 roadside assistance—towing, flat tires, lockouts, jump starts, and (5) Loss of use compensation—hosts receive daily payments if their car is being repaired after an incident.",
    "linkProtection": "Full protection details →",
    "qAccidentProcess": "What happens if there's an accident?",
    "aAccidentProcess": "If there's an accident: (1) Ensure everyone is safe and call 911 if needed, (2) Document the scene with photos and get a police report, (3) Report the incident through the ItWhip app within 24 hours, (4) Our claims team guides you through the FNOL (First Notice of Loss) process, and (5) Claims are typically resolved within 48-72 hours. Both hosts and guests are protected under our coverage—your personal auto insurance is not affected for covered claims.",
    "qDeductibles": "What are the deductibles?",
    "aDeductibles": "Deductibles vary by host tier: BASIC tier (40% earnings)—$2,500 deductible, STANDARD tier (75% earnings)—$1,500 deductible, PREMIUM tier (90% earnings)—$1,000 deductible. Higher tiers not only earn more but also have lower out-of-pocket costs if something goes wrong. Guests are responsible for deductibles for damage they cause, up to the security deposit amount.",
    "qEsgScore": "What is the ESG Impact Score?",
    "aEsgScore": "The ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Impact Score measures each vehicle's environmental footprint and the host's sustainability practices. It factors in: fuel efficiency, emissions category, maintenance compliance, and trip patterns. Guests can filter by ESG score to choose eco-friendly rentals. Hosts with high ESG scores earn badges and may attract environmentally-conscious guests willing to pay premium rates. This is part of ItWhip's commitment to CSRD-compliant sustainability tracking.",
    "linkEsg": "View ESG Dashboard →",
    "qMaxAC": "What is MaxAC™ certification?",
    "aMaxAC": "MaxAC™ is ItWhip's Arizona-specific certification ensuring vehicles perform in extreme desert heat. Every MaxAC™ certified vehicle has: (1) Verified working A/C tested above 100°F, (2) Proper window tinting within legal limits, (3) Maintained cooling system, and (4) Interior sun protection. In Phoenix summers, this matters. Guests never have to worry about getting into a hot car from a rental lot—MaxAC™ cars arrive cool and comfortable.",

    "plainEnglish": "Plain English Explanation",
    "deductibleExplain": "Think of a deductible as your \"skin in the game.\" If there's $3,000 in damage and you have a $1,500 deductible, you pay the first $1,500 and insurance covers the remaining $1,500.",
    "whyLowerDeductibles": "Why do higher tiers have lower deductibles?",
    "whyLowerDeductiblesAnswer": "Because you're bringing more insurance to the table. When you have commercial insurance (90% tier), your insurer has already assessed you as a lower risk—so we can offer you a lower deductible.",

    "tierComparisonTiers": "75%/90% Tier (STANDARD/PREMIUM): You bring your own coverage. You keep more money AND have lower deductibles ($1,500 or $1,000). Plus, your insurance likely has better service and faster claims because it's your policy.",
    "tierComparisonConclusion": "Bottom Line: If you're serious about hosting and plan to rent frequently, getting P2P or commercial insurance almost always pays for itself through higher earnings and lower deductibles.",

    "faqsTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqQ1": "Do I need my own car insurance to host on ItWhip?",
    "faqA1": "No. With the BASIC tier (40%), we provide all the insurance coverage. You don't need any of your own. However, if you want to earn more (75% or 90%), you'll need to bring P2P or commercial insurance that covers car sharing.",
    "faqQ2": "Will my personal auto insurance cover me while renting on ItWhip?",
    "faqA2": "Almost certainly not. Most personal auto policies explicitly exclude coverage when you're renting your car for money. Using your personal policy for car sharing could actually void your coverage entirely. We strongly recommend either staying in the BASIC tier or getting proper P2P/commercial coverage.",
    "faqQ3": "What's the difference between P2P insurance and commercial insurance?",
    "faqA3Part1": "P2P Insurance: An endorsement or separate policy specifically designed for peer-to-peer car sharing. Offered by some major insurers like State Farm, Farmers, and specialty providers. Usually more affordable than commercial. Qualifies you for the 75% tier.",
    "faqA3Part2": "Commercial Insurance: A full commercial auto policy that covers business use of your vehicle, including rentals. More expensive but comprehensive. Required for the 90% tier. Best for fleet operators or those with multiple vehicles.",
    "faqQ4": "What happens during a claim if I have my own insurance?",
    "faqA4Step1": "If you're in the 75% or 90% tier with your own insurance:",
    "faqA4Step2": "1. Your insurance is primary - we file the claim with your carrier first",
    "faqA4Step3": "2. You pay your policy's deductible (not ours)",
    "faqA4Step4": "3. If your insurer denies or doesn't fully cover the claim, our platform insurance kicks in as secondary",
    "faqA4Step5": "4. You then pay our tier deductible ($1,500 or $1,000) for any remaining amount",
    "faqA4Conclusion": "This layered approach means you're never left without coverage.",
    "faqQ5": "How long does the claims process take?",
    "faqA5": "Our target timeline: Incident Report (FNOL): Immediate upon submission, Initial Review: Within 24 hours, FDCR Documentation: 24-48 hours, Standard Resolution: 48-72 hours, Complex Claims: 5-7 business days. Most straightforward claims (minor damage, clear fault) are resolved within 3 business days.",
    "faqQ6": "Can I switch tiers at any time?",
    "faqA6": "Yes, but changes only apply to future rentals, not current bookings. To upgrade your tier, simply upload your new insurance documents and wait for fleet verification (1-2 business days). To downgrade, you can update your settings anytime—but remember you'll earn less and have a higher deductible.",
    "faqQ7": "What is Mileage Forensics and how does it affect insurance?",
    "faqA7Part1": "Mileage Forensics™ is our system that tracks odometer readings between trips to verify usage patterns. It helps with insurance by:",
    "faqA7Point1": "Detecting potential fraud (like unreported personal use)",
    "faqA7Point2": "Providing accurate data for claims",
    "faqA7Point3": "Verifying hosts are using vehicles according to their declared usage type",
    "faqA7Point4": "Giving insurance carriers confidence in our data",
    "faqA7Conclusion": "This is part of why we can offer competitive coverage—we have the data to back up claims accurately.",
    "faqQ8": "Does coverage apply if the guest drives outside Arizona?",
    "faqA8": "Coverage applies anywhere in the continental United States. However, trips to Mexico require advance approval and additional coverage. Trips to Canada are covered but require notification. Any international travel outside these areas is not covered.",
    "faqQ9": "What if I have a claim and my insurance lapses during the process?",
    "faqA9": "Claims are evaluated based on your tier status at the time of the incident, not when the claim is resolved. If you had valid 75% or 90% tier insurance when the incident occurred, that coverage applies to the claim—even if your insurance later lapses. However, any new rentals would be at the 40% tier until insurance is restored.",
    "faqQ10": "Are luxury and exotic cars covered differently?",
    "faqA10Part1": "Yes, high-value vehicles ($75K+) have additional requirements:",
    "faqA10Point1": "Enhanced guest verification (higher age minimum, credit check)",
    "faqA10Point2": "Larger security deposits ($2,500-5,000)",

    "faq1A": "Your earnings percentage depends on the insurance you bring. Platform Coverage (40%) uses our insurance, P2P Coverage (75%) requires peer-to-peer insurance like State Farm's car sharing coverage, and Commercial Coverage (90%) requires commercial auto insurance. All tiers include $1M liability coverage.",
    "faq2Q": "What's included in my tier?",
    "faq2A": "Every tier includes: $1M liability coverage, 48-hour payments, guest verification, 24/7 support, Mileage Forensics™, ESG dashboard, and tax documentation. The only difference is your earnings percentage and deductible amount.",
    "faq3Q": "Can I change my tier later?",
    "faq3A": "Yes! You can upgrade your tier anytime by adding P2P or commercial insurance. Simply upload your insurance documents and we'll verify and update your tier within 24 hours. Your new earnings rate applies to future bookings.",
    "faq4Q": "What is Mileage Forensics™ and why do hosts love it?",
    "faq4A": "Mileage Forensics™ is our GPS + OBD-II verified trip tracking system. It eliminates disputes, prevents fraud, and provides insurance-grade documentation for every rental. Hosts love it because it protects them from false claims and helps maintain lower insurance rates.",

    "certSlots": "TU-1-A Certification: Only 3 Enterprise slots remaining this quarter",
    "faq1Q": "How do you extend our existing hotel rates to transportation?",
    "faq1A": "Simple: You enter your negotiated rates once (takes 4 minutes). Our platform automatically applies the same discount percentage or fixed rate to ground transportation at those properties. If your company has 30% off at certain hotels, you get 30% off rides to/from those hotels. No new negotiations, no contracts, it just works.",
    "faq2Q": "What if our hotels aren't on your platform?",
    "faq2A": "No problem. We have three options: 1) We call your hotels and onboard them (they usually say yes immediately when they learn they'll earn 15% commission on rides), 2) We find equivalent alternatives with similar rates, or 3) We work alongside your existing bookings and just handle the transportation component. You don't lose any existing relationships.",
    "faq3Q": "How does this help with ESG/CSRD compliance?",
    "faq3A": "Ground transportation represents 23% of travel emissions but is rarely tracked properly. We automatically capture every mile, calculate Scope 3 emissions, and generate CSRD-compliant reports monthly. No manual data entry. Our TU-1-A certification exceeds CSRD requirements. You'll be ready for 2025 reporting with zero additional effort.",
    "faq4Q": "Can we keep our existing TMC?",
    "faq4A": "Absolutely! We complement TMCs, not replace them. Your TMC continues handling hotels and flights while we manage ground transportation. Or we can fully integrate - your choice. Many clients use us just for transportation rate extension. We make your TMC look good by solving their transportation gap.",
    "faq5Q": "How do you handle group events and conferences?",
    "faq5A": "Complete coordination from 1 to 5,000 attendees. We manage airport transfers, hotel shuttles, venue transportation, and executive services. Real-time tracking, automatic flight adjustments, and single invoice. Your event team gets a dedicated dashboard showing every movement.",
    "faq6Q": "What about data security and privacy?",
    "faq6A": "TU-1-A certification (exceeds industry standards). End-to-end encryption, aggregated APIs mean no personal data exposure to partners. Hotels see anonymized analytics only. GDPR/CCPA compliant by design. Your data stays yours - we never sell or share it.",
    "faq7Q": "How do you guarantee transportation availability?",
    "faq7A": "Network of 10,000+ verified professional drivers. AI predicts demand based on your bookings. 99.9% availability rate with financial penalties if we can't deliver. No surge pricing ever - rates are locked regardless of demand.",
    "faq8Q": "What's the implementation timeline?",
    "faq8A": "Week 1: Rate entry and system setup. Week 2: Integration testing with your systems. Week 3: Pilot group testing. Week 4: Full rollout. Most clients see savings from day one. No IT resources required from your side.",
    "faq9Q": "How do we know the ROI is real?",
    "faq9A": "Free ROI analysis using your actual travel data. We'll show: current transport spend, projected savings with rate extension, ESG compliance value, and invoice consolidation savings. Average client saves $900K annually. We guarantee minimum 20% cost reduction.",
    "faq10Q": "Why do hotels participate so eagerly?",
    "faq10A": "Hotels currently lose guests to Uber surge pricing and get nothing. With us, they earn 15% commission on every ride (average $500K/year), get free ESG compliance ($180K value), and guests stop complaining about transport. They literally make money solving your transport problem. It's a win-win-win.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqSubtitle": "Common questions about guest accounts",
    "faq1Question": "Do I need an account to book a car?",
    "faq1Answer": "No! You can start booking as a guest. When you verify your identity during booking, we automatically create your account using your driver's license information. No signup forms needed.",
    "faq2Question": "When is my card charged?",
    "faq2Answer": "Your card is authorized (held) when you submit your booking, but NOT charged until the host approves your request. If declined, the authorization is released and you're never charged.",
    "faq3Question": "What happens after I book?",
    "faq3Answer": "After booking, you'll receive an email confirmation. The host reviews your request (usually within hours). Once approved, you'll complete onboarding (Stripe verification) and coordinate pickup details with the host.",
    "faq4Question": "How do credits and bonuses work?",
    "faq4Answer": "Credits and bonuses are automatically applied to eligible bookings at checkout. You can view your balances in your account dashboard. Credits typically cover rental costs, while deposit wallet funds reduce your security deposit.",
    "faq5Question": "Can I cancel my booking?",
    "faq5Answer": "Yes, cancellation policies vary by host. Free cancellation is typically available up to 24-48 hours before pickup. Check the specific car's cancellation policy before booking.",
    "faq6Question": "What documents do I need?",
    "faq6Answer": "You need a valid driver's license (not expired). For booking, upload your DL front and back. During onboarding, you'll complete Stripe Identity verification which includes a selfie. Having your own auto insurance can reduce your deposit by 50%.",
    "faq7Question": "How is ItWhip different from traditional rentals?",
    "faq7Answer": "ItWhip is a peer-to-peer platform where local hosts share their personal vehicles. This means more variety, better prices, and a personal touch. Unlike big rental companies, you're renting from real people in your community.",
    "faq8Question": "What if something goes wrong during my trip?",
    "faq8Answer": "ItWhip provides 24/7 support for all trips. Every booking includes insurance coverage. In case of accidents, breakdowns, or issues, contact us immediately and we'll help coordinate with the host and insurance.",

Protection plans made available through our platform are contractual agreements that may include third-party liability insurance coverage provided by licensed insurers. ItWhip facilitates connections between vehicle owners and renters and provides certain protections as described below.\n\nIMPORTANT: Physical damage protection provided by ItWhip is a contractual agreement, not an insurance policy. We will reimburse eligible damage costs up to the vehicle's actual cash value or $200,000, whichever is less, subject to the deductible and terms of your selected protection plan.\n\n6.2 PROTECTION PLAN COVERAGE\n\nEvery trip includes our Standard Protection Plan featuring:\n• Up to $1,000,000 in third-party liability protection*\n• Physical damage protection with deductible options\n• 24/7 roadside assistance\n• Trip interruption coverage\n\n*Third-party liability protection is provided under a policy issued to ItWhip by our insurance partner and is subject to terms, conditions, and exclusions.

Terms and exclusions apply. See additional incorporated terms about protection plans.\n\n6.6 GUEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nBy booking this vehicle, you acknowledge that:\n1.

    "fordMustangGtFaq0Answer": "The coupe is slightly stiffer and sportier. The convertible is perfect for enjoying Arizona's weather—imagine cruising through Sedona with the top down. Most Phoenix renters prefer the convertible experience.",
    "fordMustangGtFaq1Question": "How does it compare to the Hellcat?",

    "fordMustangGtFaq2Question": "Is it a good daily driver?",
    "fordMustangGtFaq2Answer": "Yes! Modern Mustangs have comfortable interiors, good visibility, and reasonable fuel economy in normal driving. It's muscle car fun that you can actually live with day-to-day.",

    "jeepWranglerFaq1Question": "How do I remove the top?",
