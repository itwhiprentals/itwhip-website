      icon: IoBusinessOutline,
      content: `ItWhip was born from a simple observation: while technology has transformed how we book flights and hotels, finding reliable, affordable transportation at your destination remained a challenge.

Founded in Phoenix, Arizona, our team brings together decades of experience in hospitality technology and transportation logistics. We started by helping hotels connect with global distribution systems, managing over 500 properties across the Southwest. Through this work, we discovered that 87% of hotels lack reliable transportation solutions for their guests.

In 2023, we launched our peer-to-peer car sharing platform to solve this problem. By connecting local vehicle owners with travelers, we create a win-win: hosts earn extra income from their idle vehicles, while guests enjoy affordable, convenient transportation options.

Today, ItWhip operates across Arizona with over 700 vehicles available for rent. We're proud to be Phoenix's homegrown alternative to traditional car rental, offering vehicles that are 25-40% more affordable while providing hosts with the highest revenue share in the industry.

Our unique advantage comes from our technology heritage. Unlike other platforms, we seamlessly integrate with hotel booking systems, making it easy for properties to offer transportation as an amenity without any operational overhead. This creates a better experience for everyone - hotels, hosts, and guests alike.`

      icon: IoHeartOutline,
      content: `MISSION STATEMENT

To democratize transportation access by creating a trusted marketplace that empowers vehicle owners to generate income while providing travelers with affordable, quality mobility solutions.

CORE VALUES

Community First:
We believe in the power of community. Every vehicle shared strengthens our local economy, with hosts earning an average of $850 per month in supplemental income. We're not just a platform - we're neighbors helping neighbors.

Trust & Safety:
Your safety is our priority. Every host and guest goes through comprehensive verification, including identity checks and driving record reviews. All trips include up to $1 million in liability protection, giving you peace of mind on every journey.

Transparency:
No hidden fees, no surprises. Our pricing is clear and upfront. Hosts keep 80-85% of rental revenue - the highest in the industry. Guests see the total cost before booking. We believe honest business is good business.

Sustainability:
Car sharing reduces the need for vehicle ownership and decreases urban congestion. One shared vehicle on ItWhip replaces 9-13 privately owned cars, reducing CO2 emissions by 3.4 tons annually per vehicle. We're committed to a greener Phoenix.

Innovation:
We leverage cutting-edge technology to make car sharing seamless. From instant booking to contactless pickup, embedded insurance to real-time support, we're constantly improving the experience for our community.

Accessibility:
Transportation should be available to everyone. We offer multiple payment options, no credit check requirements for basic rentals, and maintain affordable pricing to ensure our service is accessible to all Phoenix residents and visitors.`
