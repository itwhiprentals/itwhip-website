    "The DCT shifts were telepathic. Perfect heel-toe downshifts and the LSD really planted the rear through corners. Sport+ mode completely changed the throttle mapping.",
    "Loved the naturally aspirated response. No turbo lag, just linear power delivery. The Brembos had zero fade even after spirited canyon runs.",
    "The chassis tuning is sublime. Perfect 50/50 weight distribution and you can really feel it. The steering ratio is aggressive but not twitchy.",
    "Variable valve timing really shows above 6k RPM. The VTEC crossover is addictive. Short throw shifter was precise with perfect gate spacing.",
    "The electronically controlled dampers made a huge difference between comfort and track modes. Roll bars kept everything flat through the twisties.",
    "Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires provided insane grip. Could really push it through the apex. The mechanical LSD is so much better than electronic.",
    "Twin-scroll turbo spools so quickly. Minimal lag and the overboost function in sport mode adds serious midrange punch.",

  ],
  electric: [
    "Regen braking set to max for one-pedal driving. The instant torque is addictive. 0-60 in under 3 seconds never gets old.",

    "Autopilot with FSD beta was mind blowing. Navigate on autopilot handled the interchange perfectly. Summon actually worked in the parking garage.",
    "The heat pump efficiency was impressive in cold weather. Only lost about 20% range at 30Â°F. Preconditioning while plugged in is a game changer.",
    "CCS fast charging compatibility meant more options than just Superchargers. The built-in trip planner with charger preconditioning was brilliant.",
    "The frunk and trunk space was massive without an engine. The camp mode with climate control running off the battery was perfect for waiting.",
